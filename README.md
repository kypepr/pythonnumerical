Python Numerical Methods


All the Jupyter Notebook codes can be found at pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu.

jupyter notebook command :
 - shift + enter --> execute code cell
 - module name + dot + TAb --> quick view of what is in the module
- the description of any function is available by typing **function**?

Every time a function in math module is typed, it is always typed math.function_name. Alternatively, there is a simpler way.
For example, if we want to use sin and log from math
module, we can import them as follows: from math import sin, log.With this modified import
statement, when using these functions, use them directly, e.g., sin(20) or log(10).

- Use function type to check the data type for different values

log function in Python is loge, or the natural logarithm. It is not log10.
